      <h4>POAP (free crypto stickers)</h4>
      <div class="container mb-3">
        <p>
          <a href="https://poap.xyz/">POAP</a> stands for "proof of attendance protocol".
          POAPs are like stickers or digital badges that you can collect at events, both to
          prove that you were there and to remember the occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting a Vibecamp POAP is totally free (there's not even gas fees), but you do need
          an Ethereum wallet and address. If you don't have one yet, install
          <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a> or <a href="https://rainbow.me/">Rainbow</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need help, ask in the Discord or tweet at us.
