      You're not in a cabin yet. Pop over to the #cabins channel in

      and say hi. Or if you want to take it easy, we'll find one for you.
      No worries!
    {{ else }}
      Your cabin is <strong>{{ .Cabin }}</strong> and you're sharing it with these lovely people:
      <ul>
          {{ range $val := .Cabinmates }}
            <li><a href="https://twitter.com/{{ $val }}">@{{ $val }}</a></li>
          {{ end }}
      </ul>
