            CHECK IN
        </h3>

        <p>
            We'll be giving you wristbands at check in. Ethereal entities will be summoned from the dark to march out anyone we see without a wristband so you MUST CHECK IN.
        </p>

        <p>
            Check in time begins at 12pm Thursday, June 15th. It will be at the gazebo marked on our map [will be linked here soon]. If you have a project you'd like extra time to set up, or to help with general event set up, you must get approval from <a href="https://twitter.com/gptbrooke">Brooke</a> to come early.

            SAFETY

        <p>

            We will have an incredible crew of humans helping volunteer at camp. They will be identifiable via their snazzy light up cowboy hats! If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, please let one of them know. If you have trouble finding a volunteer, head to the check in station on Thursday, or the information booth near the dining hall Friday & Saturday. Please also let one of us know if people are rude; if we get enough Bad Vibes report on any one person, we may decide to ask them to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a situation that is an emergency but not enough of one to call 911, you can call <a href="tel:+14152641581">415-264-1581</a> to be connected to a staff member immediately.
